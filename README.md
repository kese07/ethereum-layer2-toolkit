# Ethereum Layer 2 Toolkit

## Overview
The **Ethereum Layer 2 Toolkit** is an open-source project designed to provide developers with tools to easily integrate and deploy applications on Ethereum Layer 2. It includes **modular frameworks**, **deployment utilities**, and **smart contracts** tailored to Ethereum Layer 2 solutions such as **Optimism**, **Arbitrum**, and **zk-Rollups**.

## Features:
- **Deployment Toolkit**: Simplifies contract deployment on Layer 2 chains.
- **Smart Contract Templates**: Pre-built contracts for revenue sharing, event ticketing, etc.
- **Modular Integrations**: Easily integrate with Ethereum Layer 2 solutions (Optimism, Arbitrum).

## Milestones
- **Milestone 1**: Testnet deployment of core features (Deployment tools, smart contracts)  
- **Milestone 2**: User feedback and optimization  
- **Milestone 3**: Mainnet deployment and onboarding developers

## Goals
- Provide **tools for faster Ethereum Layer 2 development**.
- **Expand Ethereumâ€™s Layer 2 ecosystem** with open-source tools.
